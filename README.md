# Library-System
This project is for maintaining a stock of a library located in Qatar. It starts with a stock file that includes the books as lines with the first line as the identifier of each book's detail. The main problem is to find a way to read and store the books from that file and also keep the stock up to date. Thankfully, I was able to do so without the help of other Python libraries like JSON and Pickles. It is build with the concept of list of books.

# NOTE: The project was made using very simple beginner level Python to make it easely understandable by all audience.

Operations included in the system:

1-Adding a book

2-Updating a book's copies

3-Deleting a book

4-Listing stocked books # that prints the stock in a nice tabular form with the the total price of a book's copies in the last column

5-Finding a book by ISBN

6-Finding books by a given publisher

7-Finding books by a given author

8-Showing books above the average price

9-Showing stock statistics 

The system is run through the main function in the LibrarySysem.py file with the help of the functions stored in the StockMethods.py file.
